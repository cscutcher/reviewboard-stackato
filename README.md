reviewboard-stackato
====================

Code to install instance of reviewboard on stackato host. May also be of use to people on cloudfoundry.

Still not working quite right yet. Especially using `easy_install --user -U .` as a post_stage hook is especially naff. 


Usage 
-----

In theory;
  stackato push

should work.
